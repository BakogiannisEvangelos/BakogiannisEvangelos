  ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Evangelos Bakogiannis! I recently graduated with a degree in Computer Science, and I'm excited to start my career as a Front End Web Developer. I have a solid foundation in HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript, and I'm eager to apply my skills to build visually appealing and user-friendly web applications. While I may not have experience with specific JS frameworks, I'm confident in my ability to adapt and learn quickly. I have a can-do attitude, and I'm always looking for new challenges to push myself to the next level. I'm excited to work with others to build amazing web experiences that users will love.
